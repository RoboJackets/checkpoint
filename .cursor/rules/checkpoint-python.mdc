This repository is a Python Flask application. It uses Poetry for dependency management.

Any Python commands must be prefixed with "poetry run" so that they execute within the virtual environment created by Poetry.

All code should pass linters:

poetry run black checkpoint.py

poetry run flake8 checkpoint.py

poetry run pylint checkpoint.py

poetry run mypy --strict --scripts-are-modules checkpoint.py
